In the folder, you will find these files:
- images.py: contains the `Image` class that will read and write the images using the PNG `Writer` and `Reader`
- png.py : pure python PNG `Writer` and `Reader` classes from Johann C. Rocholl
- transform.py : implemented image filter functions.
- output folder: contains the output of the two images of lake and city in different filter styles and compare to the originals.
